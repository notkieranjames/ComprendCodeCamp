        <p>Of course, 'serif' and 'sans serif' are themselves broad classifications – each split
          into several sub-categories. Generally speaking, Old Style serifs such as Bembo, Caslon and
           Garamond will combine well with Humanist sans serifs, such as Gill Sans and Lucida Grande.
            Meanwhile, Transitional serifs have a stronger contrast between thick and thin strokes –
            examples include Bookman, Mrs. Eaves, Perpetua and Times. These pair with Geometric sans
            serifs such as Avant Garde, Avenir, Century Gothic, Eurostile, Futura and Univers. Finally,
             Modern serifs have an often very dramatic contrast between thick and thin for a more pronounced
             , stylised effect, as well as a larger x-height. Included in this third sub-category are Bodoni,
              Didot, New Century Schoolbook and Walbaum. Again, Geometric sans serifs marry best with these.
              So what does all this actually look like in practice? Here's our reference list of tried-and-testing
              font pairings that are guaranteed to avoid conflict.</p>
